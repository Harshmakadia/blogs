Here is the list of things that the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\">official react website</a> has to say about the problems that will be solved.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Its-hard-to-reuse-stateful-logic-between-components\"><a href=\"#Its-hard-to-reuse-stateful-logic-between-components\" aria-label=\"Its hard to reuse stateful logic between components permalink\" class=\"gatsby-remark-autolink\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>It’s hard to reuse stateful logic between components</h3>\n<p>Reusable behavior cannot be attached to the React component. A good example of it could be connecting to the store. If you’ve some experience in React, you may be knowing some of the patterns like <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html\">render props</a> and <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html\">higher-order components</a> that can be handy while solving such problems. Using such patterns, components have to be restructured in order to use them making code harder to follow and maintain.</p>\n<p>With the introduction of Hooks, stateful logic can be extracted from the component. This allows it to be tested independently, and it can be reused.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> <strong><em>With Hooks, you can reuse stateful logic without actually changing your component hierarchy.</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"Complex-components-become-hard-to-understand\"><a href=\"#Complex-components-become-hard-to-understand\" aria-label=\"Complex components become hard to understand permalink\" class=\"gatsby-remark-autolink\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Complex components become hard to understand</h3>\n<p>There are times when a component grows from having a small state to an unmanageable state of stateful logic.</p>\n<p>Each lifecycle method sometimes contains a mix of unrelated logic. For example, a component might perform some data fetching via API calls in componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. However, the same componentDidMount method might also contain some of the unrelated logic.</p>\n<p>This logic sets up event listeners with cleanup performed in componentWillUnmount. Related code that changes together gets split.\nThe unrelated code which is combined into a single method brings in bugs and inconsistencies.</p>\n<p>We often come across a situation where we are not able to split a large component into smaller ones because of the stateful values. Also, it becomes difficult to test them.</p>\n<p>To solve this problem, <strong>Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related. A good example of it could be setting up a subscription or fetching data</strong>, irrespective of code split based on the lifecycle method.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> <strong><em>With Hooks, more of React’s features can be used without the need for classes.</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"But-how-do-Hooks-really-work\"><a href=\"#But-how-do-Hooks-really-work\" aria-label=\"But how do Hooks really work permalink\" class=\"gatsby-remark-autolink\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>But how do Hooks really work?</h2>\n<p>Here is the code snippet we saw above:</p>\n <iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/7c9a265be91cd05f631700b75fd3dd7c\" frameborder=0></iframe>\n <iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/44c1ba4d30d6dfee85364c3e3bffddd5\" frameborder=0></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/lpokw8ox67\">Link to CodeSandbox</a></p>\n<p>The use of useState is the Hook that we are talking about.</p>\n<p>We call it inside a function component to add a local state to it. React will preserve this state between all the re-rendering happening. useState returns a pair which has the <em>current</em> state value and a function that lets you update the value.</p>\n<p>You can call this function from an event handler or from somewhere else. It’s similar to this.setState in a React class, but it doesn’t merge the old and new state altogether.</p>\n<p>There is only one argument to useState that is the initial state. In this example given above, the initial state is 0 because our counter starts from zero. Note that unlike this.state, the state here doesn’t have to necessarily be an object — however it can be an object if you want.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Declaring-multiple-state-variables\"><a href=\"#Declaring-multiple-state-variables\" aria-label=\"Declaring multiple state variables permalink\" class=\"gatsby-remark-autolink\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Declaring multiple state variables</h3>\n <iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/6170d331dcb1a24241b4f3a71ee6c205\" frameborder=0></iframe>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Array_destructuring\">array destructuring</a> syntax gives different names to the state variables which we declared by calling useState.

We call these operations as “side effects” (or “effects” in short).</p>\n<p>The Effect Hook, useEffect, adds the ability to perform the side effects from a function component. It has the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but unified into a single API.</p>\n<p>For example, the below component sets the document title after React updates the DOM:</p>\n <iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/84e0e841171c49aeeb499c0db5dfcfd4\" frameborder=0></iframe>\n <iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/365de5aa81bd46e176e6270655c91cb6\" frameborder=0></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://wn8q6741xl.codesandbox.io/\">Link to CodeSandbox</a></p>\n<p>When you make a call to useEffect, you’re telling React to run your “effect” function after flushing changes to the DOM. Effects are declared inside the component and thus have access to its props and state. By default, React runs the effects after every render that happens— <em>including</em> the first render.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Rules-of-Hooks\"><a href=\"#Rules-of-Hooks\" aria-label=\"Rules of Hooks permalink\" class=\"gatsby-remark-autolink\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Rules of Hooks</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*f4sJzaPTgNR0g95mmVCI3g.png\" alt=\"Hooks Rules\"></p>\n<p>Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they have two additional rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only call Hooks <strong>at the top level</strong>.
